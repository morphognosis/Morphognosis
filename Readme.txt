Morphognosis: the shape of knowledge in space and time

The brain can be viewed as a solution to problems posed by an environment existing in space and time. 
The environment generates signals that produce sensory events within an organism. Building an internal 
spatial and temporal model of the environment allows an organism to navigate and manipulate the environment. 
This notion is embodied in a model called morphognosis (morpho = shape and gnosis = knowledge). 
Its basic structure is a pyramid of event recordings called a morphognostic. At the apex of the pyramid 
are the most recent and nearby event recordings. Receding from the apex are recordings of less recent 
and possibly more distant events. A morphognostic can thus be viewed as a structure of progressively larger chunks 
of space-time knowledge. Matching a current morphognostic with a learned set of morphognostics allows a 
response to be selected that serves some purpose to the organism. The set of morphognostics forms a long-term memory 
that can be learned by exposure to the environment. A cellular automaton is used as the platform to investigate the 
morphognosis model.
